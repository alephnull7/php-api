This is somewhat generic OOP approach to a SQL-based PHP API. Specifically, the example implementation is using a PostgreSQL database hosted through AWS's RDS service, and the server itself is hosted on an AWS EC2 server within a Docker container.

Currently, the API is located at: https://13.58.25.183/api.

Note that the HTTPS connection currently is using a self-signed SSL certificate.
